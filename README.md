# st7-machine-axiale
This is the repository to share all the code that was develop during ST7 Energy for the Axial Machine project.
This repository contains all MATLAB files needed to see the simulations of our axial flux synchrone machine. The project was developed between 19 February 2020 and 07 April 2020. The project will be presented at CentraleSupélec (7 April 2020).

## Getting Started
In order to see our files, just clone the repository in your local machine and you can run the simulations with [FEMM](http://www.femm.info/wiki/Download). The parameters of the simulations are (usually) written and defined in .m scripts for each run of the simulation.

## Prerequisites
In order to well run the files, you will need
- MATLAB R2019b
- Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM)
